# Jupyter Notebooks - Mark as documentation to exclude from language statistics
# This keeps the educational value (outputs remain) but doesn't count toward repo language stats
*.ipynb linguist-documentation

# Alternative: Mark as generated (if you prefer)
# *.ipynb linguist-generated

# You can also be more specific if needed:
# notebooks/*.ipynb linguist-documentation
# examples/*.ipynb linguist-documentation
