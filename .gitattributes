# Exclude the heavy notebook with lots of outputs from language statistics
fft_test.ipynb linguist-generated=true

# Keep other notebooks (like f0_extraction.ipynb) counted normally
# This shows Jupyter/data science skills without overwhelming the stats

# Alternative configurations if needed:
# *.ipynb linguist-documentation   # Mark all notebooks as documentation
# *.ipynb linguist-language=Python  # Count all notebooks as Python
# *.ipynb linguist-generated=true  # Exclude all notebooks from stats
